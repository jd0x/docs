Fetching data over relationships
================================

Let's assume that we have an array relationship from the ``author`` table to the ``article`` table and an object
relationship from the ``article`` table to the ``author`` table.

To obtain the **author**'s name from the article table, we issue,

.. code-block:: http

   POST /v1/query HTTP/1.1
   Content-Type: application/json
   Authorization: Bearer <auth-token> # optional if cookie is set
   X-Hasura-Role: <role>  # optional. Required if request needs particular user role

   {
       "type" : "select",
       "args" : {
           "table" : "article",
           "columns": [
               "title",
               {
                   "name": "author",
                   "columns": ["name"]
               }
           ],
           "where" : {"is_published" : true}
       }
   }

The same syntax can be used to obtain the titles of all articles across all **authors**.

.. code-block:: http

   POST /v1/query HTTP/1.1
   Content-Type: application/json
   Authorization: Bearer <auth-token> # optional if cookie is set
   X-Hasura-Role: <role>  # optional. Required if request needs particular user role

   {
       "type" : "select",
       "args" : {
           "table" : "author",
           "columns": [
               "name",
               {
                   "name": "articles",
                   "columns": ["title"]
               }
           ]
       }
   }

You can use relationships inside ``where`` clause. For example, if we wish to only fetch all published articles by
author with name ``Warren`` , we could :

.. code-block:: http

   POST /v1/query HTTP/1.1
   Content-Type: application/json
   Authorization: Bearer <auth-token> # optional if cookie is set
   X-Hasura-Role: <role>  # optional. Required if request needs particular user role

   {
       "type" : "select",
       "args" : {
           "table" : "article",
           "columns": [ "id", "title"],
           "where" : {
               "is_published" : true,
               "author" : {
                   "name" : "Warren"
               }
           }
       }
   }

Let's fetch authors who have never published anything.

.. code-block:: http

   POST /v1/query HTTP/1.1
   Content-Type: application/json
   Authorization: Bearer <auth-token> # optional if cookie is set
   X-Hasura-Role: <role>  # optional. Required if request needs particular user role

   {
       "type" : "select",
       "args" : {
           "table" : "author",
           "columns": ["name"],
           "where" : {
               "$not" : {
                   "articles" : { "$any" : { "is_published" : true }}
               }
           }
       }
   }

As you probably guessed, relationships can be nested. Let's get all published articles with author information, comments
and the author who posted the comment.

.. code-block:: http

   POST /v1/query HTTP/1.1
   Content-Type: application/json
   Authorization: Bearer <auth-token> # optional if cookie is set
   X-Hasura-Role: <role>  # optional. Required if request needs particular user role

   {
       "type" : "select",
       "args" : {
           "table" : "article",
           "columns": [
               "title",
               {
                   "name": "author",
                   "columns": ["name"]
               },
               {
                   "name" : "comments",
                   "columns" : [
                       "comment",
                       {
                           "name" : "commented_by",
                           "columns" : ["name"]
                       }
                   ]
               }
           ],
           "where" : {"is_published" : true}
       }
   }

We can also use ``where``, ``limit``, ``offset`` inside array relationships. Let's say we want to fetch all authors and
only their published articles:

.. code-block:: http

   POST /v1/query HTTP/1.1
   Content-Type: application/json
   Authorization: Bearer <auth-token> # optional if cookie is set
   X-Hasura-Role: <role>  # optional. Required if request needs particular user role

   {
       "type" : "select",
       "args" : {
           "table" : "author",
           "columns": [
               "name",
               {
                   "name": "articles",
                   "columns": ["title"],
                   "where" : { "is_published" : true }
               }
           ]
       }
   }
