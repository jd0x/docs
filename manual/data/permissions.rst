Data permissions and access control
===================================

The data APIs, by default can only be accessed by users with the ``admin`` role. However, we should never include the admin token in any client applications. So, we need to allow access to the data APIs for roles other than ``admin``. This is handled by the permission layer of the data APIs, which lets you define **row level** and **column level** access control policies for various roles.

What are the typical roles other than ``admin``?

#. ``user`` for logged in users
#. ``anonymous`` for users who haven't logged in.

We need to define permissions on all the tables that we have created so far (where applicable) for ``user`` and ``anonymous`` roles. We can use the data API to create permissions.

The hasura API gateway forwards ``X-Hasura-*`` headers with each request to the data microservice. So, when a data API call is made with an ``auth_token`` representing some user, the data microservice knows the user's roles and a variable called ``REQ_USER_ID`` is updated with the ``hasura_id`` of the user making the call. This variable can now be used to describe the access permissions for rows in tables.

Select permissions
------------------

To allow ``select`` access to roles based on the below configuration

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Role
     - Columns
     - Rows
   * - anonymous
     - all columns
     - which are published
   * - user
     - all columns
     - which are published and those written by the user (published or not)

For ``anonymous`` role:

.. code-block:: http

   POST data.<cluster-name>.hasura-app.io/v1/query HTTP/1.1
   Content-Type: application/json
   Authorization: <admin-token>

   {
      "type" : "create_select_permission",
      "args" : {
           "table" : "article",
           "role" : "anonymous",
           "permission": {
              "columns" : "*",
              "filter" : {
                "is_published" : true
            }
          }
      }
   }

The response would be as follows:

.. code-block:: http

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
       "message" : "success"
   }

We've specified ``*`` for ``columns`` as a short hand notation for all columns. ``filter`` is used to specify the rows that can be read. You may have noticed that the syntax is similar to that of ``where`` in ``select`` query. In fact, they are exactly the same. The only difference is that, in ``filter`` you can use a special placeholder variable ``REQ_USER_ID`` for the ``id`` of the user who makes the query. We'll see this in action when defining the select permission for ``user`` role on ``article`` table.

For ``user`` role:

.. code-block:: http

   POST data.<cluster-name>.hasura-app.io/v1/query HTTP/1.1
   Content-Type: application/json
   Authorization: <admin-token>

   {
       "type" : "create_select_permission",
       "args" : {
           "table" : "article",
           "role" : "user",
           "permission": {
              "columns" : "*",
              "filter" : {
                "$or" : [
                    { "is_published" : true },
                    { "author_id" : "REQ_USER_ID" }
                ]
             }
           }
       }
   }

The response would be as follows:

.. code-block:: http

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
       "message" : "success"
   }

Insert permissions
------------------

To allow ``insert`` access to roles based on the below configuration

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Role
     - Check
   * - anonymous
     - Cannot insert
   * - user
     - if the user is the author


``anonymous`` role cannot insert into ``article`` table, hence no permissions need to be set.

For ``user`` role, one should only be able to create an article with themself as the author, i.e, you should not be allowed to set arbitrary ``author_id`` when inserting into ``article`` table. This is an assertion that must be verified before the data is persisted.

.. code-block:: http

   POST data.<cluster-name>.hasura-app.io/v1/query HTTP/1.1
   Content-Type: application/json
   Authorization: <admin-token>

   {
       "type" : "create_insert_permission",
       "args" : {
           "table" : "article",
           "role" : "user",
           "permission": {
             "check" : {
                 "author_id" : "REQ_USER_ID"
             }
           }
       }
   }

With insert, you only get to specify the assertion that has to be validated with ``check``.

The response would be as follows:

.. code-block:: http

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
       "message" : "success"
   }


Update permissions
------------------

To allow ``update`` access to roles based on the below configuration

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Role
     - Columns
     - Rows
   * - anonymous
     - None
     - None
   * - user
     - title, content, is_published
     - those written by the user

``anonymous`` role cannot update the data in ``article`` table, hence no permissions need to be set.

For ``user`` role:

.. code-block:: http

   POST data.<cluster-name>.hasura-app.io/v1/query HTTP/1.1
   Content-Type: application/json
   Authorization: <admin-token>

   {
       "type" : "create_update_permission",
       "args" : {
           "table" : "article",
           "role" : "user",
           "permission": {
             "columns" : ["title", "content", "is_published"],
             "filter" : {
                 "author_id" : "REQ_USER_ID"
             }
           }
       }
   }

Update permission syntax is the same as select permission's. You specify the columns that can be updated with ``columns`` and the rows that can be updated using ``filter``.

The response would be as follows:

.. code-block:: http

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
       "message" : "success"
   }

Delete permissions
------------------

To allow ``delete`` access to roles based on the below configuration

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Role
     - Rows
   * - anonymous
     - None
   * - user
     - those written by the user

``anonymous`` role cannot delete the data in ``article`` table, hence no permissions need to be set.

For ``user`` role:

.. code-block:: http

   POST data.<cluster-name>.hasura-app.io/v1/query HTTP/1.1
   Content-Type: application/json
   Authorization: <admin-token>

   {
       "type" : "create_update_permission",
       "args" : {
           "table" : "article",
           "role" : "user",
           "permission": {
              "columns": ["title", "content"],
              "filter" : {
                 "author_id" : "REQ_USER_ID"
             }
           }
       }
   }

With delete, you only get to specify the rows that are allowed to be deleted with ``filter``.

The response would be as follows:

.. code-block:: http

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
       "message" : "success"
   }
