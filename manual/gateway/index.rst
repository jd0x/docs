API Gateway
===========

The Hasura API Gateway (or simply the gateway) is a microservice consisting of
a custom Lua scripted Nginx, a Let's Encrypt agent and a Redis instance.

It is responsible for routing all external requests to the correct upstream
(acting as a reverse proxy), terminating SSL connections and resolving sessions
for upstream microservices (acting as a session middleware).
