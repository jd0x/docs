The complete tutorial: Learn by example
=======================================

This is a simple, in-depth tutorial to understand how Hasura works and how you
can build a backend for your application, a blog engine in this example, with
Hasura.

.. note::
    The Hasura CLI is needed for working with Hasura. If you haven't installed it yet,
    please see :doc:`../install-hasura-cli`

At the end of this tutorial, you will understand:

- what Hasura projects and clusters are,
- how to use the Hasura APIs to avoid writing backend code
- how to deploy your own microservices on a Hasura cluster
