=======================================
Part XII: Custom code and microservices
=======================================

Not all requirements will be met by the Hasura APIs.
Custom APIs and microservices like API integrations or UI microservices will always
be needed to be added specifically to the project.

Hasura provides an easy way to run microservices by specifying ``docker`` images
or by directly pushing code via ``git``.

Let us explore 2 use cases.

Custom code: Adding a simple web-server to serve a UI
-----------------------------------------------------

We'll use a Nodejs Express microservice for the server. To do this, we'll use the ``nodejs-express`` microservice template for initialization.

Initialize the microservice (we'll call it ``www``) using:

.. code-block:: console
		
	  $ hasura microservice generate www --template nodejs-express

This will create a directory called ``www`` inside your ``microservices`` directory, which  will contain a ``k8s.yaml`` file, a ``Dockerfile`` and the source code for the Nodejs Express server. 

The ``k8s.yaml`` file contains the Kubernetes specs for the microservice. The ``Dockerfile`` is used by the Hasura platform
to automatically build your code in the right environment.

Let's modify ``www/app/server.js``, to just serve one sample request:

.. snippet:: javascript
   :filename: server.js

   var express = require('express');
   var app = express();

   app.get('/', function (req, res) {
     console.log('Request received');
     res.send('Hello world!');
   });

   app.listen(8080, function () {
     console.log('Example app listening on port 8080!');
   });


Add a route so that the microservice can be reached externally:

.. code-block:: console
		
	  $ hasura conf generate-route www
	  
:: 

    www:
      /:
	corsPolicy: null
	enableAuth: true
	enableCORS: true
	enableWebsockets: true
	locationDirectives: ""
	restrictToRoles: []
	upstreamService:
	  name: www
	  namespace: '{{ cluster.metadata.namespaces.user }}'
	upstreamServicePath: /
	upstreamServicePort: 80


Add the output above to the ``conf/routes.yaml``.

If you want to have a separate git remote to push your code to, you can use the ``hasura remote generate`` command to do so.

Make sure that you've added your SSH public key to the cluster using

.. code-block:: console

	  $ hasura ssh-key add
	  
Once that is done, you're ready to push!

.. code-block:: bash

   # in the root of your project directory
   $ git add .
   $ git commit -m "added www microservice"
   $ git push hasura master

Voila, your microservice is deployed and live! In case there are any errors in building or deploying your code,
the ``git push`` command will show you errors and the push will fail. Fix the error, commit and push again!

.. admonition:: Behind The Scenes

   The Hasura platform basically builds a docker image from the latest git changes
   pushed by you, and deploys the right kubernetes microservice, deployment underneath.

   If you want finer control over your deployment, you are encouraged to use ``kubectl``
   and peek under the hood of the microservice that is automatically deployed.

Docker: Adding a custom database browser (adminer)
--------------------------------------------------

To add a custom microservice, in your project directory execute:

.. code-block:: console

   $ hasura microservice generate adminer --image clue/adminer --port 80

This will create a directory inside the ``microservices`` directory called ``adminer`` which will contain a ``k8s.yaml`` file.
This file describes the Kubernetes configuration for your microservice.

Next, generate the routes for this microservice:

.. code-block:: console
		
	  $ hasura conf generate-route adminer
	  
::

     adminer:
       /:
	 corsPolicy: null
	 enableAuth: true
	 enableCORS: true
	 enableWebsockets: true
	 locationDirectives: ""
	 restrictToRoles: []
	 upstreamService:
	   name: adminer
	   namespace: '{{ cluster.metadata.namespaces.user }}'
	 upstreamServicePath: /
	 upstreamServicePort: 80


Add this output to the ``conf/routes.yaml`` file.

Finally, use ``git commit`` and ``git push`` to deploy the configuration and microservices to the cluster.

That's all you need to do. If you head to ``https://adminer.<cluster-name>.hasura-app.io`` you'll see
the familiar ``adminer`` UI.

.. admonition:: Automatic SSL certificates

   The Hasura platform automatically creates Grade A SSL certificates using LetsEncrypt.

   SSL certificate creation can take a few minutes. During this time ``https://adminer.test42.hasura-app.io``
   will not be served, and you'll have to access your microservice on ``http`` instead. As soon as
   the certificate is ready, ``http://adminer.test42.hasura-app.io`` will automatically
   start redirecting to the ``https`` version.
