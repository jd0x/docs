Billing for Hasura
==================

Having an active billing account is mandatory to create :doc:`pro-tier clusters <../cluster/pro-tier/index>`
on Hasura. Billing accounts can be created and managed in the `Hasura Dashboard <https://dashboard.hasura.io/projects>`_.
This section details the process of adding and modifying a billing account.

Adding and activating billing account
-------------------------------------

Log in to `Hasura Dashboard <https://dashboard.hasura.io/projects>`_ and add
your payment details at https://dashboard.hasura.io/account/billing. You will be
asked to add credit card related information like card details, your name and
the billing address. Your card will also be temporarily charged with $1 to
verify the information provided. **This transaction will be reversed immediately
after the verification** in a few minutes.


Modifying billing information
-----------------------------

You may want to modify your billing information to either change details like CVV, billing address,
etc. or replace a saved card.

Changing the saved card
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To replace a saved card, please drop a note to support@hasura.io from your registered email address.
We will work with our payment service provider to clear the details of your current card and notify you.
You are then expected to add a replacement card within 72 hours. Failure to do so may lead to your pro-tier
clusters being temporarily suspended.

Changing billing information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To change your billing details like CVV, address, etc., please drop a note to support@hasura.io from
your registered email address. You will be notified once the details have been updated.

Cancelling your subscription
----------------------------

To cancel your subscription, simply :doc:`delete <../cluster/delete>` your pro-tier clusters. Your card
will be charged as usual at the end of the billing cycle for the outstanding amount.

Transfer ownership of a cluster
-------------------------------

Drop a note to support@hasura.io from your registered email address, copying the new owner.
