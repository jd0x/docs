Mobile/OTP based authentication
===============================

This provider supports mobile based **password-less** authentication. The way it
works is, user's mobile number is used to send an OTP (One Time Password) on their mobile phone.
Once they receive the OTP, they can use that to signup or login.


.. note::

  For this provider to send OTP via SMS, you have to :doc:`enable a SMS provider <../../notify/sms/index>` in
  the Hasura Notify microservice.

Signup
------

To signup a user, first the user has to get an OTP on their mobile number.

To get an OTP, use the ``/v1/providers/mobile/send-otp`` endpoint.

.. code-block:: http

   POST auth.<cluster-name>.hasura-app.io/v1/providers/mobile/send-otp HTTP/1.1
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
      "mobile": "9876543210",
      "country_code": "91"
   }


Once the OTP is obtained, then the user should make a signup request.

.. code-block:: http

   POST auth.<cluster-name>.hasura-app.io/v1/signup HTTP/1.1
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "provider" : "mobile",
     "data" : {
        "mobile": "9876543210",
        "country_code": "91",
        "otp": "123456"
     }
   }


If the request is successful, Hasura Auth will create and login the user.

Typical response of the ``/v1/signup`` request is :

.. code-block:: http

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "auth_token": "b4b345f980ai4acua671ac7r1c37f285f8f62e29f5090306",
     "mobile": "9876543210",
     "hasura_id": 79,
     "hasura_roles": [
         "user"
     ]
   }
