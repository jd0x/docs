Authenticating users
====================

Hasura Auth has support for multiple ways to authenticate (ie: login/register) a user.
e.g. username-based, email-based, mobile-based, etc. Social login is also supported via providers like google, facebook, github, etc.

Hasura Auth calls each authentication method a **"provider"**.
