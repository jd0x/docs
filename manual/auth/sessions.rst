Understanding user sessions
===========================

When a user is logged-in, a session is attached.

A session is nothing but a unique, un-guessable identifier  attached to that
Hasura Auth user account (referred to as ``auth_token``) for that session. This
way a user can make subsequent requests without having to authenticate with
credentials on every request. Instead, on every request, the user can present
the ``auth_token`` to identify themself.

Every microservice benefits from having the user's information (id and roles) with
each request. In the Hasura platform, every request goes through the API
Gateway. So, the API Gateway integrates with the session store to act as a
session middleware for all microservices.

When the gateway receives a request, it looks for a session token in the
``Bearer`` token of ``Authorization`` header or in the cookie. It then
retrieves the user's id and roles attached to this session token from the
session store. This information is sent as ``X-Hasura-User-Id`` and
``X-Hasura-Role`` headers to the upstream microservice.

When the session token is absent from both header and cookie, the gateway
considers it an anonymous request and adds the header ``X-Hasura-Role:
anonymous``. The ``X-Hasura-User-Id`` header is **not** set in this case.


.. _session-expiry:

Session Expiry
--------------
A user session will expire:

* when a logout action is requested
* password is changed
* role is assigned or unassigned
* sessions are expired explicitly by any admin user

Handling/Storing session tokens
--------------------------------

Sessions are managed by Hasura Auth and the API Gateway. Whenever a request is
made API Gateway resolves the session from ``Authorization`` header or
**cookies**.

Web-apps
~~~~~~~~
If you are building browser-based apps, then Hasura Auth APIs already sends
appropriate cookie headers. You don't have to do any additional work to manage
sessions tokens, except making appropriate API calls and browser handles the
rest for you.

Mobile / other device apps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you are building mobile/device apps, then you have to make your own
mechanism for storing session tokens (``auth_token``) and managing them. That
is - storing, updating and deleting them whenever a Hasura Auth API returns a
new session token, and remove all existing tokens (``auth_token``) on the above
conditions.
