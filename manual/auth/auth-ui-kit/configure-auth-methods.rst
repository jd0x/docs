Adding/removing authentication methods from Auth UI Kit
=======================================================

The Auth UI kit adapts automatically to display all the :doc:`auth providers <../authentication/providers/index>` enabled in the Auth config.
By default, only the :doc:`username provider <../authentication/providers/username>` is enabled.

Refer to :doc:`../authentication/providers/configure-auth-methods` to add/remove more authentication methods.
